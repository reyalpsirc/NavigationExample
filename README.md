# NavigationExample

This project was made as an example solution for the problem reported on [https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/18818/custom-page-transitions-with-xamarin-forms](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/18818/custom-page-transitions-with-xamarin-forms)

Please note that this project only works with pages that have `NavigationPage.SetHasNavigationBar (this, false);` and that it could still be improved (since there are some accesses to a static variable).

At least it works and can be an example for people looking for this on iOS :)
